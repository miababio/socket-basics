                                    NOTES
                                    -----
                                    
Getting Started
    - Before, we used HTTP requests between the client and the server to manage and retrieve data (GET, POST, etc.)
    - With sockets, we can get the server to push live data to the client, without the client having to request anything
        - Can be useful for examples like messaging (chat app), or email
    - 2-way communication; Client can ask/receive info, and the server can do the same
    - Setting up for using sockets
        - Express -> version 4.13.3
        - server.js
            - Difference this time is that we are starting the server with built-in node modules, instead of using express
            - See Example 1
    
    
 
                                  Examples
                                  --------
                            
Example 1 - Setup for Socket.io
---------
var PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
var express = require("express");
var app = express();

// Tells Node to start a new server and use the Express app as a boilerplate
// Anything the Express app listens to, the server should listen as well
var http = require("http").Server(app);

app.use(express.static(__dirname + "/public"));

http.listen(PORT, function() {
   console.log("Server started!"); 
});
